- Create a script that chooses a random image from wallpapers.json
- Set the gnome background to that image
- Use ESM syntax
- Allow the use of an env variable `WALLPAPER_CATEGORY` to filter the images
- The categry maps to folder in the wallpapers.json file
- Do not download multiple wallpapers. Only keep one at a time to save space.
- Keep it as simple as possible
